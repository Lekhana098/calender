The goal of calendar is to make it easy to create, read, write, and work with iCalander (.ics, .ical or similar) files,
and the scheduling data they represent, in R. iCalendar is an open standard for “exchanging calendar and scheduling information between users and computers”
described aticalendar.org (the full spec can be found in a plain text file here).
